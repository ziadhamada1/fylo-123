    •	The Interagency GPS Executive Board (IGEB) was an agency of the United States federal government that sought to integrate the needs and desires of various governmental agencies into formal Global Positioning System Planning.

        •	GPS was administered by the Department of Defense, but had grown to service a wide variety of constituents.

            It is a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) that provides geographic position
            and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near Earth where there is an
            unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.

        <h3>the definition</h3>
    <p>
       
        They are very accurate GPS receivers installed in known locations, 
        through which they record discrepancies 
        between known and calculated locations resulting from slight
         differences in the orbits of satellites. There are a number 
         of monitoring stations that have been distributed throughout
          the world, and they are equipped with standards for atomic
           clocks and devices. GPS receiver to always collect GPS data 
           for all satellites viewed from their positions. The collected 
           data is sent to the master control station where it is processed 
           to estimate satellite orbits and clock errors.

    <div class="info">
        <h3>the use</h3>
        <p>
            The geographical positioning system via satellite allows
             the location to be known accurately without any error. 
             The size of the error depends on the quality of the receiver
              used on land and at sea. In daily life, the Global Positioning System (GPS)
             is widely used by motor vehicle drivers and many other people.
